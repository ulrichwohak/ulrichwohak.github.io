   <p align="justify">We study price and volume effects of value-added tax (VAT) reductions for period products. We exploit varying treatment intensities and timing in several European countries and find that prices decrease by 10–13 %. This corresponds to full pass-through 12 months after the VAT reduction. The average effect on aggregate purchase volumes is statistically zero, and we find no evidence that low-income households are disproportionately affected by the reforms. We find homogeneous pass-through for market- and product-level competition measures and provide suggestive evidence that households’ propensity to purchase branded products increases in the months after the tax reform.</p>

***Start-up acquisitions, venture capital and innovation: A comparative study of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (2025)*** Wohak, U., [Gugler, K.](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/gugler-k), [Szücs, F.](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/szuecs-f). *International Journal of Industrial Organization*.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p align="justify">We evaluate the impact of big-tech acquisitions on the incentives for venture capital (VC) investment and innovation. Using data on several hundred acquisitions by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM), we study the evolution of VC investment and patenting in affected technology fields relative to control groups. The results show a clear negative impact on VC investment, while the effect on innovation depends on the acquirer and period. Over time, the treatment effects on both outcomes improve, as GAFAM firms' product and tech-portfolios become more similar. Yet, around 14% of acquisitions impact both metrics negatively.</p>

***Using Natural Language Processing to Delineate Digital Markets (2024)*** Wohak, U., [Gugler, K.](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/gugler-k), [Szücs, F.](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/szuecs-f). *Stanford Computational Antitrust*.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p align="justify">Delineating relevant antitrust markets poses substantial challenges, particularly so in nascent, digital markets, where data on prices, quantities, and costs often are not available. This study evaluates a complementary approach using Natural Language Processing techniques along with business descriptions of relevant firms to define markets. Applying this method to a sample of start-up acquisitions, we find considerable overlap between our approach and expert assessments by the European Commission.</p>
