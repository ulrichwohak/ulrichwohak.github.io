  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p align="justify">We evaluate the impact of big-tech acquisitions on the incentives for venture capital (VC) investment and innovation. Using data on several hundred acquisitions by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM), we study the evolution of VC investment and patenting in affected technology fields relative to control groups. The results show a clear negative impact on VC investment, while the effect on innovation depends on the acquirer and period. Over time, the treatment effects on both outcomes improve, as GAFAM firms' product and tech-portfolios become more similar. Yet, around 14% of acquisitions impact both metrics negatively.</p>

## Under Review

- ***Evaluating Tampon Tax Reforms using Transaction Based Scanner Data*** (with [Klara Kinnl](https://sites.google.com/view/klarakinnl)), *R&R at Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization*

  - *A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the European Parliament's [FEMM committee workshop](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/de/product/product-details/20221202WKS04761) on 08/12/2022.*
  
  - In this project we evaluate the causal impact of various tax reductions for mentrual hygiene products on prices as well as quantities purchased. We find close to full pass-through but muted effects on quantities purchased. 

  - We find that the tax reduction translates into prices dynamically over a period of at least 12 months.
